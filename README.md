Controlling LEDs using Arduino Serial Port

Requirement: 
- python 3 
- tkinter (pip3 install tkinter3-tk)
- pyserial (pip3 install pyserial)

to run call: python3 main.py

The idea is pretty similiar to [this](http://bildr.org/2011/01/arduino-serial/), but with 
LEDs placed in a square like [here](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/images/arduino/seeed/IMG_2850.jpg).

As you see you can update code to use not only LEDs, but anything you want.
